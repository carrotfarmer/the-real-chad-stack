![giga chad](https://dudeproducts.com/cdn/shop/articles/gigachad_1068x.jpg?v=1667928905)

the most amazing stack for developing web applications.

## the stack

- Go
- Gin (http framework)
- GORM (ORM)
- SQLite
- HTMX and Hyperscript
- tailwind
- Auth0 (totally not because of skill issue)
	- but its so expensive, why?
		well none of my stuff are gonna cross 0 MAU so ðŸ¤·

## pros

- blazingly fast (it's literally just html)
- very maintainable (Go is awesome)
- no javascript (so you don't ship react, svelte, prisma, nextjs 13, react server component crap for your stupid-ass website)
- low abstractions (so you actually know what's going on in your code)

## cons


## running locally

- enter auth0 credentials .env file
- run `go mod vendor` to install dependencies
- `go run main.go` or `air` if you have it installed
